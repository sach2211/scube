Now the important question - 

## What is scube ?
This tool is intended to help in easily exploring and updating your S3 data.

## Why is scube needed ?
Most of the S3 explorers work as browser plugin and do not allow you to easily navigate the file hierarchy. 

This tool, displays your files in a file tree, like you see in text editors.




### Note :
Your bucket must have read access for everyone and allow CORS request (atleast from this domain i.e. github.com).

Please be aware , that by default, this is not enabled. Please update the CORS settings of your bucket for this tool to work.
